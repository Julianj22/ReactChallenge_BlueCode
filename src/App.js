//to a differnt location

// CHALLENGE: Wonka has come up with a new candy idea! "Rando-Pop!"â„¢ ...
// When you take a bite of this endless fun, a random candy ends up on your tongue!
// The candy is still in the development stages, so it's your job to, well... develop it!
// hint: how can we randomize items in JS?
